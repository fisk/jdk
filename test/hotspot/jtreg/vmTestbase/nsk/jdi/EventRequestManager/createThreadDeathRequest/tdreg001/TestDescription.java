 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdi/EventRequestManager/createThreadDeathRequest/tdreg001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *     The test for the implementation of an object of the type
 *     EventRequestManager.
 *     The test checks up that a result of the method
 *     com.sun.jdi.EventRequestManager.createThreadDeathRequest()
 *     complies with its spec:
 *     public ThreadDeathRequest createThreadDeathRequest()
 *      Creates a new disabled ThreadDeathRequest.
 *      The new event request is added to the list managed by this EventRequestManager.
 *      Use EventRequest.enable() to activate this event request.
 *      Returns: the created ThreadDeathRequest
 *     The test checks up on the following assertions:
 *     - Creates a new disabled ThreadDeathRequest.
 *     The test works as follows:
 *     The debugger program - nsk.jdi.EventRequestManager.createThreadDeathRequest.tdreg001;
 *     the debuggee program - nsk.jdi.EventRequestManager.createThreadDeathRequest.tdreg001a.
 *     Using nsk.jdi.share classes,
 *     the debugger gets the debuggee running on another JavaVM,
 *     creates the object debuggee.VM, and waits for VMStartEvent.
 *     Upon getting the debuggee VM started,
 *     the debugger calls corresponding debuggee.VM methods to get
 *     needed data and to perform checks.
 *     In case of error the test produces the return value 97 and
 *     a corresponding error message(s).
 *     Otherwise, the test is passed and produces
 *     the return value 95 and no message.
